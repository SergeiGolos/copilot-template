### **TV Show:** Veep

### **Character Profiling**

- **Selina Meyer:** Ambitious, narcissistic, and relentlessly driven.
  Her primary focus is her own political advancement. She is a poor
  long-term strategist, often making decisions based on immediate
  emotional reactions and political expediency. She is a terrible
  manager, creating a toxic environment where her staff competes for her
  approval.

- **Amy Brookheimer:** Selina\'s former Chief of Staff. She is
  incredibly dedicated, organized, and a master of crisis management.
  She is a workaholic who thrives under pressure and is skilled at
  anticipating problems and orchestrating complex political maneuvers.
  However, she is also high-strung, prone to explosive outbursts, and
  often sacrifices her personal life for her job.

- **Kent Davison:** A data-driven political strategist obsessed with
  polls and numbers. He is emotionally detached, viewing politics and
  people as variables in a complex equation. His communication style is
  blunt and robotic, and he often clashes with those who operate on
  intuition or emotion.

- **Ben Cafferty:** The cynical and world-weary White House Chief of
  Staff. He is a seasoned political operator who has seen it all. He is
  pragmatic, unflappable in a crisis, and provides brutally honest,
  albeit often pessimistic, advice. He is a master of managing chaos and
  keeping the ship afloat, even when it\'s sinking.

- **Dan Egan:** A ruthless and ambitious communications professional. He
  is a master of networking and self-promotion, always looking for his
  next career move. He is charming but completely self-serving, willing
  to backstab anyone to get ahead.

- **Mike McLintock:** The affable but incompetent Director of
  Communications and later Press Secretary. He is generally well-liked
  but consistently fails at his job, often making situations worse
  through his ineptitude. He prioritizes his personal comfort and
  avoiding work over professional excellence.

- **Sue Wilson:** Selina\'s hyper-competent and unflappable personal
  secretary. She is the gatekeeper, managing Selina\'s schedule with
  ruthless efficiency and a deadpan demeanor. She is completely unfazed
  by the chaos around her and is one of the few truly effective people
  on the team.

- **Gary Walsh:** Selina\'s devoted \"bag man.\" He is intensely loyal
  and anticipates Selina\'s every personal need. While not a political
  strategist, he has an encyclopedic knowledge of Selina\'s personal
  preferences and history. His devotion often borders on the obsessive.

- **Richard Splett:** A kind, earnest, and surprisingly competent aide
  who often finds himself in positions of increasing responsibility
  through a combination of luck and genuine helpfulness. He is a font of
  obscure knowledge and approaches every task with unwavering optimism
  and a desire to do a good job.

- **Jonah Ryan:** A universally despised and incompetent political
  hanger-on who manages to fail upwards. He is arrogant, obnoxious, and
  completely lacking in self-awareness. His primary skill is being in
  the right place at the wrong time.
