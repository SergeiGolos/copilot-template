### **Step 1 & 2: Developer Roles & TV Show**

This analysis maps characters from the TV show *Frasier* to specific
software development team roles based on their personalities and skills
as portrayed in the series.

### **Step 3: Character Profiling**

- **Dr. Frasier Crane:** A psychiatrist and radio host, Frasier is
  intelligent, articulate, and highly educated, but also pompous,
  insecure, and overly analytical. He craves respect and sees himself as
  a leader and a man of taste. He often overcomplicates simple problems
  with his psychological theories but has a genuine desire to help
  people. He is a natural, if sometimes flawed, leader of his ensemble.

- **Dr. Niles Crane:** Frasier\'s younger brother, also a psychiatrist.
  Niles is even more fastidious, elitist, and neurotic than Frasier. He
  is exceptionally detail-oriented, precise, and methodical. He has deep
  knowledge in his specific domain (psychiatry) and values order,
  structure, and correctness above all else. His obsession with getting
  every detail right often leads to comical paralysis.

- **Martin Crane:** Frasier and Niles\' father, a retired police
  detective. Martin is pragmatic, down-to-earth, and straightforward. He
  represents the user\'s perspective---he cuts through his sons\'
  intellectual nonsense to find the simple, practical solution. He has a
  strong sense of right and wrong and is a keen observer of human
  behavior from a practical, real-world standpoint.

- **Daphne Moon:** Martin\'s live-in physical therapist and housekeeper.
  Daphne is empathetic, intuitive, and people-focused. She has a quirky,
  sometimes \"psychic\" insight into the emotional states of others. She
  is caring and patient, acting as the social and emotional glue that
  holds the often-fractious household together.

- **Roz Doyle:** Frasier\'s radio show producer. Roz is savvy,
  organized, and fiercely competent. She manages the technical aspects
  of the show, wrangles callers, and keeps Frasier on track and on
  schedule. She is adaptable, resourceful, and skilled at managing chaos
  and coordinating moving parts under pressure. She has a pragmatic,
  no-nonsense approach to getting the job done.

- **Gil Chesterton:** The food critic at KACL. Gil is dramatic,
  meticulous, and obsessed with the finest details of quality and
  presentation. He is relentless in his pursuit of perfection and has a
  very narrow, specific focus where his expertise shines.

- **Bob \"Bulldog\" Briscoe:** The sports show host at KACL. Bulldog is
  aggressive, impulsive, and focused on one thing: breaking things and
  moving fast. He is not concerned with quality or long-term
  consequences, only with immediate, high-impact results. His approach
  is often crude but effective for short-term gains.

- **Bebe Glazer:** Frasier\'s agent. Bebe is a master manipulator and
  strategist, solely focused on maximizing Frasier\'s career success
  (and her commission). She is ruthless, amoral, and brilliant at
  stakeholder management, risk assessment, and seeing the \"big
  picture\" from a purely business-oriented perspective.
