### **Character Profiles**

- **Jake Peralta:** A talented but immature detective. He is creative, a
  gifted problem-solver, and thrives on challenges, but can be
  disorganized and impulsive. He is fiercely loyal to his friends and
  driven by a strong sense of justice.

- **Amy Santiago:** An ambitious, hyper-organized, and competitive
  detective who loves rules, binders, and pleasing authority figures.
  She is incredibly intelligent, detail-oriented, and a stickler for
  procedure.

- **Captain Raymond Holt:** The stoic, robotic, and seemingly
  emotionless captain of the 99th precinct. He is a brilliant
  strategist, a stickler for rules and efficiency, and deeply cares for
  his squad. He is a visionary leader who values logic and precision.

- **Rosa Diaz:** A tough, intimidating, and intensely private detective.
  She is fiercely independent, highly competent, and has a wide range of
  unexpected skills. She is a loyal friend but expresses it through
  actions rather than words.

- **Charles Boyle:** A clumsy, awkward, and overly enthusiastic
  detective who is also a die-hard foodie. He is Jake\'s best friend and
  is incredibly loyal, supportive, and hardworking. He is surprisingly
  competent and has a unique way of looking at things.

- **Terry Jeffords:** The gentle giant of the precinct, a muscular
  sergeant who loves his family and yogurt. He is a caring and
  responsible leader who is focused on the well-being of his team. He is
  also a talented artist and a surprisingly sensitive soul.

- **Gina Linetti:** The precinct\'s civilian administrator, who is
  narcissistic, sarcastic, and obsessed with social media. She is
  surprisingly perceptive, has a unique understanding of people, and is
  a master of manipulation and social engineering.

- **Hitchcock & Scully:** Two aging, lazy, and incompetent detectives
  who are more interested in food and naps than police work. However,
  they have moments of surprising competence and possess a deep, albeit
  strange, friendship.
