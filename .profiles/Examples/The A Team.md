## TV Show Cast to Developer Role Mapping: The A-Team

### Step 1 & 2: Developer Roles & TV Show Seed

This analysis maps the developer and agent roles defined in the
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE files to characters from the classic TV show,
*The A-Team*.

### Step 3: Character Profiling

- **Colonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith:** The leader and master tactician
  of the A-Team. He is a brilliant strategist, a master of disguise, and
  thrives on complex, high-stakes situations where the odds are stacked
  against them. His catchphrase, \"I love it when a plan comes
  together,\" perfectly encapsulates his strategic satisfaction. He is
  the undisputed brains of the operation, always thinking several steps
  ahead and demonstrating an uncanny ability to predict his opponents\'
  moves. His love for being \"on the jazz\" means he actively seeks out
  challenges that push the team to its limits.

- **Lieutenant Templeton \"Face\" Peck:** The smooth-talking, charming
  con man and logistics expert. Face is incredibly resourceful, able to
  acquire anything the team needs---from a fleet of cars to a
  helicopter---through persuasion, charm, and guile. He is the team\'s
  procurement specialist and is excellent at interacting with clients
  and stakeholders, often acting as the initial point of contact to
  gather information and assess the situation. His ability to seamlessly
  adopt new personas makes him a master of social engineering.

- **Sergeant B.A. Baracus:** The team\'s muscle and mechanical genius.
  B.A. (Bad Attitude) is a highly skilled mechanic who can build or fix
  anything, often creating custom armored vehicles and powerful,
  non-lethal gadgets from whatever scraps are available. He is also the
  team\'s enforcer and a formidable fighter, providing the muscle to
  back up Hannibal\'s plans. Despite his gruff exterior and famous fear
  of flying, he has a strong moral compass and a soft spot for helping
  those in need, especially children.

- **Captain H.M. \"Howling Mad\" Murdock:** The team\'s expert pilot,
  certified insane, and a master of many voices and characters. Murdock
  can fly any type of aircraft with incredible skill, making him an
  indispensable asset for transportation and aerial support. His
  \"insanity\" is often a front for his brilliant, unorthodox thinking,
  allowing him to create diversions and devise solutions that no one
  else would consider. His unpredictable nature makes him a wild card,
  but his loyalty to the team is absolute.

- **Amy Amanda \"Triple A\" Allen:** An investigative journalist who
  often hires the team and becomes an integral part of their early
  missions. She is intelligent, resourceful, and an expert at gathering
  information, conducting research, and understanding the \"user\'s\"
  (client\'s) needs. Her journalistic skills allow her to uncover
  crucial details and expose the villains, providing the team with the
  intelligence they need to succeed.

- **Frankie \"Dishpan Man\" Santana:** A special effects expert who
  joins the team in the final season. He is skilled in creating
  convincing illusions, explosions, and other practical effects, which
  are often used to deceive and disorient their adversaries. His
  technical skills add another layer of sophistication to the team\'s
  operations, allowing for more elaborate and deceptive plans.

- **Colonel Roderick Decker:** One of the primary military antagonists
  sent to capture the A-Team. He is relentless, methodical, and
  single-minded in his pursuit. Unlike other adversaries, he has a
  grudging respect for Hannibal\'s skills. He meticulously studies the
  team\'s methods, always looking for flaws in their plans and trying to
  exploit any potential weakness, making him a persistent and
  predictable threat.
