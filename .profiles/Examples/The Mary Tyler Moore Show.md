### **Step 2: TV Show Seed**

- **TV Show:** The Mary Tyler Moore Show

### **Step 3: Character Profiling**

- **Mary Richards:** The show\'s protagonist, Mary is an associate
  producer at WJM-TV. She is kind, diplomatic, and exceptionally
  competent. She often acts as the mediator and problem-solver in the
  chaotic newsroom, balancing the clashing personalities of her
  colleagues. She\'s organized, user-focused (on the viewer), and always
  strives for a quality newscast.

- **Lou Grant:** Mary\'s boss, the producer of the Six O\'Clock News. On
  the surface, Lou is gruff, tough, and cynical. Beneath his hard
  exterior, he is a caring mentor with a deep commitment to journalistic
  integrity and quality. He has high standards and can be demanding, but
  he also has a keen sense of the bigger picture and the station\'s
  direction.

- **Murray Slaughter:** The head newswriter for WJM. Murray is witty,
  intelligent, and a talented writer who is consistently frustrated by
  his work being mangled by the inept anchorman, Ted Baxter. He is a
  reliable and hardworking team player who is passionate about the
  quality of his own work and the final product. He has a good-natured,
  albeit cynical, sense of humor.

- **Ted Baxter:** The vain, dim-witted, and hilariously incompetent
  anchorman for the WJM news. Ted is obsessed with his public image and
  is blissfully unaware of his own shortcomings. He often causes
  problems through his lack of understanding and his focus on
  superficial details. However, he is not malicious and can occasionally
  show moments of surprising insight or loyalty.

- **Rhoda Morgenstern:** Mary\'s best friend and upstairs neighbor for
  the first few seasons. Rhoda is a window dresser who is creative,
  outspoken, and has a sarcastic, self-deprecating sense of humor. She
  is very creative and has a great eye for aesthetics and what will
  appeal to people.

- **Sue Ann Nivens:** The host of WJM\'s \"The Happy Homemaker\" show.
  Sue Ann is outwardly sweet and cheerful, but behind the scenes, she is
  man-hungry, competitive, and manipulative. She is also an impeccable
  planner and a perfectionist in her own domain, always ensuring her
  show runs smoothly and that she is the star.

- **Phyllis Lindstrom:** Mary\'s snobbish and self-absorbed landlady and
  friend. Phyllis is flighty and often meddles in Mary\'s life, but she
  is also a fiercely loyal friend. She is very particular and has a high
  standard for how things should be done.

- **Georgette Franklin Baxter:** Ted\'s sweet, gentle, and somewhat
  ditzy girlfriend, and later wife. Georgette is unfailingly kind and
  patient, especially with Ted. She has a unique way of seeing the world
  and often cuts through the nonsense with simple, honest observations.
  She is surprisingly resilient and has a quiet strength.
