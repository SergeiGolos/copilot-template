## Step 2: TV Show Seed

- **TV Show:** Fawlty Towers

## Step 3: Character Profiling

- **Basil Fawlty:** The proprietor of Fawlty Towers. He is arrogant,
  snobbish, and desperate to attract a higher class of clientele. Basil
  is prone to fits of rage and elaborate, farcical schemes that
  invariably backfire. He is a micro-manager who thinks he has a grand
  vision but consistently fails in execution due to his terrible people
  skills and inability to handle pressure.

- **Sybil Fawlty:** Basil\'s wife. She is the practical and
  sharp-tongued manager of the hotel. While Basil is scheming, Sybil is
  often seen on the phone, gossiping, or managing the hotel\'s finances
  with a cynical but realistic approach. She is the true, albeit often
  disengaged, operational core of the hotel.

- **Polly Sherman:** The waitress and general assistant. She is the most
  competent and level-headed person on staff. Often an aspiring artist,
  she is intelligent, resourceful, and frequently dragged into Basil\'s
  schemes, which she tries to mitigate or fix with common sense and
  quick thinking.

- **Manuel:** The well-meaning but hopelessly confused waiter from
  Barcelona. He has a poor grasp of English, which leads to constant
  misunderstandings and mishaps. He is loyal and tries his best, but his
  actions often inadvertently sabotage Basil\'s plans.

- **Major Gowen:** A permanent resident of the hotel. He is an elderly,
  dotty, and slightly senile former military officer. He is often out of
  touch with reality and provides moments of surreal, unintentional
  comedy.

- **Terry the Chef:** The laid-back, slightly cocky chef who replaced
  the temperamental Kurt. He is competent in the kitchen but operates on
  his own terms, often with a relaxed attitude that clashes with
  Basil\'s high-strung nature.

- **Miss Tibbs & Miss Gatsby:** Two elderly, sweet-natured permanent
  residents. They are often bewildered by the chaos around them but
  remain unfailingly polite and loyal to the hotel.
