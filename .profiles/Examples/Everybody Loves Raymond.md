## TV Show Cast to Developer Role Mapping: Everybody Loves Raymond

### Character Profiles

- **Ray Barone:** A successful sportswriter who is generally lazy,
  selfish, and avoids responsibility at home. He is skilled in his
  specific creative field but often creates or exacerbates problems
  through his immaturity and reluctance to engage in difficult
  conversations.

- **Debra Barone:** Ray\'s wife and the functional head of their
  household. She is organized, pragmatic, and often overwhelmed by the
  chaos of the Barone family. She constantly tries to implement
  structure and manage the competing needs of her husband, children, and
  intrusive in-laws.

- **Robert Barone:** Ray\'s older brother, a police officer. He is
  defined by a deep-seated jealousy of Ray\'s perceived perfect life.
  Robert is meticulous, detail-oriented (to the point of neuroticism),
  and has a very particular, methodical way of doing things.

- **Marie Barone:** The family matriarch. She is an intrusive,
  manipulative, and controlling perfectionist, especially regarding
  cooking, cleaning, and her sons\' lives. She is relentless and
  believes her way is the only right way, constantly \"testing\" and
  criticizing Debra\'s household management.

- **Frank Barone:** The family patriarch. A stubborn, brutally honest,
  and cantankerous retiree. He is a pragmatist who avoids work whenever
  possible and has a knack for keeping the \"infrastructure\" of his
  lazy lifestyle running smoothly. He is resilient and unbothered by
  conflict.

- **Amy MacDougall:** Robert\'s on-again, off-again girlfriend and
  eventual wife. She is patient, kind, and often acts as a buffer or
  coordinator between Robert and the rest of the family. She is
  adaptable and skilled at managing difficult personalities.

- **Gianni:** One of Ray\'s friends. He is a follower who is quick to
  jump in on Ray\'s schemes. He\'s good at taking a basic idea from Ray
  and helping to adapt it to the situation at hand.
