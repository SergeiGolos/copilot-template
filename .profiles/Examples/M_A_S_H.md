## Step 3: Character Profiling

### Main & Supporting Characters

- **Captain Benjamin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce:** The brilliant, deeply
  humanistic chief surgeon. Hawkeye is a master of his craft, constantly
  innovating under pressure. However, he is also an anti-authoritarian
  rule-breaker who uses wit and pranks to cope with the horrors of war.
  He is the moral and emotional center of the unit, often seeing the
  bigger picture beyond military protocol.

- **Colonel Sherman T. Potter:** A career military man and a firm but
  fair leader. He brings stability and order to the chaotic 4077th.
  Colonel Potter is pragmatic, wise, and deeply cares for his team,
  acting as a father figure. He manages the diverse and often
  conflicting personalities under his command with a steady hand,
  ensuring the mission\'s success.

- **Corporal Walter \"Radar\" O\'Reilly:** The company clerk with an
  almost supernatural ability to anticipate needs and navigate
  bureaucracy. Radar is exceptionally organized, resourceful, and loyal.
  He is the operational core of the unit, ensuring that everything runs
  smoothly behind the scenes, from securing supplies to managing
  communications.

- **Major Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan:** A highly skilled and
  dedicated head nurse. Initially a rigid, by-the-book officer, she
  evolves into a more compassionate and adaptable leader. Margaret is a
  strong advocate for her nursing staff and patients, demanding
  excellence and demonstrating great resilience.

- **Captain B.J. Hunnicutt:** A skilled surgeon and devoted family man.
  B.J. is Hawkeye\'s moral compass and loyal friend. He is more grounded
  and less cynical than Hawkeye, often providing a steadying influence.
  He is a meticulous and reliable professional who values doing things
  the right way.

- **Major Charles Emerson Winchester III:** A highly skilled,
  aristocratic surgeon from a wealthy Boston family. Initially arrogant
  and aloof, Charles is a perfectionist who takes immense pride in his
  work. He possesses a deep knowledge of medicine and a hidden
  compassionate side that emerges over time.

- **Major Frank Burns:** An incompetent and arrogant surgeon who hides
  his insecurities behind rigid military protocol and patriotic fervor.
  He is meticulous in following rules but lacks the skill and critical
  thinking to be an effective doctor. His primary concern is his own
  status and appearance.

- **Father John Mulcahy:** The camp\'s chaplain, offering moral support
  and guidance. He is empathetic, a great listener, and often acts as
  the conscience of the unit. He is resourceful in his own quiet way,
  finding ways to help those in need, both spiritually and practically.

- **Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger:** A resourceful and adaptable soldier
  initially focused on getting a Section 8 discharge by cross-dressing.
  Over time, he proves to be a dedicated and effective company clerk
  after Radar\'s departure. Klinger has a knack for \"scrounging\" and
  making deals, demonstrating a creative and unconventional approach to
  problem-solving.
