### **Step 1 & 2: Developer Roles & TV Show Seed**

- **TV Show:** Trailer Park Boys

### **Step 3: Character Profiling Summaries**

- **Julian:** The perpetual schemer and self-proclaimed leader of the
  park. He is focused on the \"big picture\" of his get-rich-quick
  plans, managing the other characters, and maintaining a stoic,
  in-control demeanor, rarely seen without his rum and coke. He handles
  the high-level planning and delegation.

- **Ricky:** The master of execution in very specific, often illegal,
  fields. He is an expert horticulturist (for marijuana), a decent
  mechanic, and a surprisingly effective (though chaotic)
  problem-solver. His methods are unorthodox and destructive, but he
  often gets the job done through sheer persistence and creative
  profanity. He is famous for his malapropisms, or \"Rickyisms.\"

- **Bubbles:** The heart and conscience of the group. He is meticulous,
  detail-oriented, and possesses a surprising range of technical skills,
  from fixing shopping carts to building sheds and wrestling equipment.
  He is the voice of reason and morality, often pointing out the flaws
  in Julian\'s plans and worrying about the consequences. He loves his
  cats (\"kitties\") fiercely.

- **Jim Lahey:** The alcoholic trailer park supervisor and the boys\'
  primary antagonist. As a disgraced former police officer, he is
  obsessed with surveillance, finding evidence, and exposing the boys\'
  schemes. His plans to catch them are often elaborate, methodical, and
  fueled by \"the liquor,\" showcasing a relentless, if deeply flawed,
  dedication to his own twisted sense of justice.

- **Randy:** Mr. Lahey\'s loyal, shirtless assistant supervisor and
  partner. He is primarily a follower, executing Lahey\'s orders without
  question. He is not a strategic thinker but is diligent in carrying
  out the tasks assigned to him, whether it\'s park maintenance or
  spying on the boys.

- **J-Roc:** A resident of the park who fully embodies the persona of a
  white, suburban rapper. He is highly creative, focused on his brand
  and image, and is the ultimate communicator for his \"Roc Pile\" crew.
  He is an entrepreneur in his own right, often producing his own
  low-budget films and music.

- **Sarah:** A pragmatic and often level-headed resident of the park.
  She acts as a go-between for different groups, translating high-level
  ideas (like Julian\'s) into understandable terms for others. She is
  clear, direct, and has a knack for writing and documentation, as seen
  when she helps the boys with legal or business paperwork.

- **Cory and Trevor:** The park\'s eternally loyal, if hopelessly
  incompetent, duo. They are the go-to grunts for any manual labor,
  always eager to please Ricky and Julian but almost guaranteed to mess
  up. They are masters of taking a simple task and failing in a
  spectacular fashion, revealing every possible weakness in a plan.

- **Sam Losco:** A veterinarian and recurring antagonist. \"The
  Caveman\" is known for his brute-force approach and singular focus.
  When a problem arises, he addresses it with direct, often aggressive,
  and unsophisticated methods. He is persistent and doesn\'t give up
  easily, even when things go horribly wrong.

- **Ray:** Ricky\'s father, a former truck driver living on disability
  for a dubious workplace injury. He embodies a mindset of doing just
  enough to get by and automating his life for maximum relaxation (e.g.,
  his \"piss jugs\"). He understands systems---like trucking logistics
  and disability claims---and how to work them with minimal effort.
