### **Step 3: Character Profiling**

- **Frank Reynolds:** A wealthy, ruthless, and hedonistic businessman
  who is the biological father of Dennis and Dee (or is he?). He is the
  chaotic financier of the gang\'s schemes and has a long history of
  morally bankrupt but often successful business ventures. He is
  impulsive, manipulative, and has a surprising depth of knowledge in
  unconventional and often illegal activities.

- **Dennis Reynolds:** A narcissistic, vain, and manipulative co-owner
  of Paddy\'s Pub. He is obsessed with his own physical appearance and
  his \"system\" for seducing women. He is highly intelligent,
  meticulous, and has a fragile ego that often leads to fits of rage. He
  sees himself as the sophisticated and charismatic leader of the group.

- **Deandra \"Sweet Dee\" Reynolds:** Dennis\'s twin sister and the
  bartender at Paddy\'s. She is insecure, desperate for fame and
  validation, and constantly the butt of the gang\'s jokes. She is a
  failed actress who is prone to fits of rage and elaborate,
  self-serving schemes that almost always backfire.

- **Charlie Kelly:** The illiterate, glue-huffing janitor of Paddy\'s
  Pub and a co-owner. He is a musical savant (as seen in \"The Nightman
  Cometh\"), an expert in \"bird law,\" and the only one who does any
  real work at the bar (\"Charlie Work\"). He is kind-hearted at his
  core but is also prone to fits of rage and has a dangerous obsession
  with \"The Waitress.\"

- **Ronald \"Mac\" McDonald:** The bouncer and a co-owner of Paddy\'s
  Pub. He is a deeply insecure man who is obsessed with his own
  masculinity, his Catholic faith, and his \"Project Badass\" workout
  regimen. He is a compulsive liar who seeks the approval of others,
  especially his father and Dennis.

- **The Waitress:** A recurring character who is the object of
  Charlie\'s obsession. She is a recovering alcoholic who is constantly
  annoyed and harassed by the gang. She is cynical, world-weary, and has
  a surprisingly resilient spirit, given the amount of torment she has
  endured.

- **Artemis Dubois:** Dee\'s friend from acting class. She is a
  free-spirited, uninhibited, and often sexually aggressive woman who is
  a frequent participant in the gang\'s schemes. She is an aspiring
  actress and performance artist with a flair for the dramatic.

- **Matthew \"Rickety Cricket\" Mara:** A former priest who was driven
  to a life of homelessness, drug addiction, and debauchery by the gang.
  He is a tragic figure who is a constant reminder of the gang\'s
  destructive influence.

- **The McPoyles (Liam and Ryan):** A creepy, inbred, and unhygienic
  family who are frequent antagonists of the gang. They are fiercely
  loyal to each other and have a bizarre and unsettling worldview.
