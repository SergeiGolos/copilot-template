### Character Profiling

- **Michael Scott:** The Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.
  Michael is an attention-seeking and often inappropriate boss who
  desperately wants to be liked by his employees. He is a talented
  salesman but lacks managerial skills, often creating more problems
  than he solves. However, he occasionally demonstrates surprising
  moments of insight and genuine care for his team.

- **Dwight Schrute:** A highly eccentric and ambitious salesman who is
  also a beet farmer. Dwight is a stickler for rules and procedures
  (often his own), and he craves authority. He is extremely
  knowledgeable about a wide range of niche topics and is fiercely loyal
  to Michael. Despite his abrasive personality, he is a top-performing
  salesman.

- **Jim Halpert:** A clever and laid-back salesman known for his
  elaborate pranks on Dwight. Jim is intelligent and capable but often
  unmotivated by his job. He is observant and has a good understanding
  of social dynamics within the office.

- **Pam Beesly:** The quiet and artistic receptionist who evolves into a
  more assertive and confident saleswoman and office administrator. Pam
  is empathetic, observant, and often the voice of reason in the office.
  She has a creative side and is skilled at communication and
  organization.

- **Angela Martin:** The stern and judgmental head of the accounting
  department. Angela is a perfectionist who is obsessed with rules,
  order, and her cats. She is highly critical of her coworkers and
  resistant to change.

- **Oscar Martinez:** A knowledgeable and rational accountant who is
  often the intellectual superior in the room. Oscar is a
  \"know-it-all\" but is generally well-respected for his intelligence
  and pragmatism. He is not afraid to question authority or point out
  logical fallacies.

- **Darryl Philbin:** The warehouse foreman who later moves into a
  corporate role. Darryl is ambitious, level-headed, and focused on
  efficiency and professional growth. He is a good leader who is
  respected by both the warehouse and office staff.
