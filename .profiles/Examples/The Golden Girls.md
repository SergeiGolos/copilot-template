### **Step 2: TV Show Seed**

- **TV Show:** The Golden Girls

### **Step 3: Character Profiling**

- **Dorothy Zbornak:** A pragmatic and intelligent substitute teacher,
  often serving as the group\'s voice of reason. She is sarcastic,
  analytical, and fiercely protective of her family and friends. Dorothy
  is a natural leader who often takes charge, organizes plans, and cuts
  through nonsense with her sharp wit. She is grounded, thoughtful, and
  provides the stable center for the household.

- **Blanche Devereaux:** A charismatic and confident Southern belle who
  works at an art museum. She is driven by a desire for romance and
  attention but is also a loyal and caring friend. Blanche is an expert
  social strategist, highly creative in her personal pursuits, and
  always focused on presentation and aesthetics. She is outgoing,
  persuasive, and has a flair for the dramatic.

- **Rose Nylund:** A kind-hearted and unfailingly optimistic woman from
  the small town of St. Olaf, Minnesota. While often naive, she
  possesses a deep well of empathy, surprising wisdom, and a strong
  moral compass. Rose is incredibly creative, especially in her
  storytelling, and her primary motivation is to help and understand
  others. She is patient, persistent, and surprisingly competitive.

- **Sophia Petrillo:** Dorothy\'s sharp-tongued and witty mother from
  Sicily. After a stroke, she lost her social filter, resulting in
  brutally honest and often hilarious observations. Sophia is the keeper
  of history and tradition, telling stories (\"Picture it\...\") that
  contain life lessons. She is incredibly detail-oriented, methodical in
  her reasoning (even if it\'s unconventional), and relentless in
  finding flaws or weaknesses in an argument or situation.

- **Stanley \"Stan\" Zbornak:** Dorothy\'s perpetually unfaithful and
  foolish ex-husband. A novelty salesman, Stan is always involved in
  some get-rich-quick scheme. He is persistent to a fault, constantly
  trying to fix his past mistakes and win Dorothy back. He has a knack
  for creating problems but also a deep-seated (if often misguided)
  desire to analyze what went wrong and correct it.

- **Miles Webber:** Rose\'s long-term boyfriend, a kind and intellectual
  college professor. He is steady, reliable, and patient, often acting
  as a calm counterpoint to the chaos of the house. His academic
  background makes him precise, articulate, and skilled at explaining
  complex ideas in a clear, understandable manner.
