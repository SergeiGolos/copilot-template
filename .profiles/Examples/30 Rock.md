### TV Show: 30 Rock

### Character Profiling

- **Jack Donaghy:** A supremely confident, strategic, and
  business-oriented network executive. He is a master of corporate
  maneuvering, branding, and management, constantly trying to impose a
  business framework onto the creative chaos of television. His
  strengths are his long-term vision, leadership, and ability to manage
  complex systems (and people).

- **Liz Lemon:** The perpetually stressed-out head writer of \"TGS.\"
  She is intelligent, creative, and fiercely dedicated, but also
  cynical, socially awkward, and prone to panic. Her primary role is to
  be the problem-solver, constantly putting out fires caused by her
  eccentric boss and volatile stars.

- **Kenneth Parcell:** An unfailingly cheerful, optimistic, and sincere
  NBC page from rural Georgia. He possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of
  television history and an almost superhuman dedication to his job and
  the people at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. He is methodical, detail-oriented,
  and operates with a rigid, almost naive moral code.

- **Pete Hornberger:** The \"sane\" producer of \"TGS.\" He is often the
  voice of reason amidst the insanity, though he is weary and beaten
  down by his job and chaotic family life. He is a skilled organizer and
  planner who tries to keep the show on schedule and on budget, despite
  the constant obstacles.

- **Toofer Spurlock:** A writer for \"TGS\" who is a proud Harvard
  graduate. He often feels his intellectual and cultural sensibilities
  are above the low-brow humor of the show and his colleagues. He values
  correctness, structure, and prestige.

- **Frank Rossitano:** A lazy, man-child writer for \"TGS,\" known for
  his trucker hats with witty slogans. He is creative in a goofy,
  unrefined way and is an expert at cutting corners and finding the path
  of least resistance. He is adaptable and quick with a joke.

- **Cerie Xerox:** Liz\'s young, attractive, and seemingly ditzy
  assistant. Despite her flighty demeanor, she is very aware of social
  trends, aesthetics, and how to present things in an appealing way. She
  represents the modern end-user, unconcerned with the technical details
  behind the scenes.

- **\"Dot Com\" Slattery:** A member of Tracy Jordan\'s entourage. He is
  surprisingly erudite, thoughtful, and well-read. He often acts as the
  stable, logical force that manages Tracy\'s chaotic life, providing
  solutions and maintaining operational stability.

- **Dr. Leo Spaceman:** A doctor with highly questionable credentials
  and even more questionable medical advice. He approaches every
  diagnosis with supreme confidence, presenting bizarre, data-like
  factoids and conclusions that are completely disconnected from
  reality.

- **Jonathan:** Jack Donaghy\'s intensely loyal and sycophantic personal
  assistant. His entire professional existence revolves around
  anticipating Jack\'s needs and translating his directives into
  perfectly executed tasks with meticulous precision.
