## TV Show Cast to Developer Role Mapping: Arrested Development

### Step 1 & 2: Developer Roles & TV Show Seed

This document maps the developer/agent roles defined in the
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE files to characters from the TV show **Arrested
Development**.

### Step 3: Character Profiling

- **Michael Bluth:** The \"one son who had no choice but to keep them
  all together.\" Michael is the responsible, pragmatic, and constantly
  exasperated center of the Bluth family. He\'s a hard worker, a natural
  leader (or at least, he tries to be), and is always putting out fires
  caused by his family\'s incompetence and narcissism. He\'s
  detail-oriented, a good communicator, and is the only one who seems to
  have any grasp of the big picture.

- **G.O.B. Bluth:** An arrogant, insecure, and spectacularly untalented
  magician. G.O.B. is impulsive, lazy, and always looking for the easy
  way out. He\'s terrible at planning, has no attention to detail, and
  his \"illusions\" are usually disasters. He\'s a master of making
  things worse and then blaming others.

- **Lindsay Fünke:** Vain, materialistic, and perpetually seeking
  attention. Lindsay is Michael\'s twin sister and is just as selfish
  and irresponsible as the rest of the family. She\'s not particularly
  bright, has no work ethic, and her \"activism\" is purely for show.

- **Tobias Fünke:** A former psychiatrist turned aspiring actor, Tobias
  is delusional, effeminate, and completely lacking in self-awareness.
  He\'s a terrible actor, a \"never-nude,\" and his attempts to be a
  part of the family business are always cringe-worthy and unhelpful.

- **George Michael Bluth:** Michael\'s painfully awkward and overly
  earnest teenage son. George Michael is responsible, hardworking, and
  desperate to please his father. He\'s meticulous, detail-oriented, and
  has a strong moral compass, which often puts him at odds with the rest
  of his family.

- **Maeby Fünke:** Lindsay and Tobias\'s rebellious and cynical
  daughter. Maeby is cunning, resourceful, and a natural con artist.
  She\'s a sharp observer of her family\'s absurdity and is skilled at
  manipulating situations to her advantage.

- **Lucille Bluth:** The manipulative, alcoholic, and hyper-critical
  matriarch of the Bluth family. Lucille is sharp, witty, and ruthless.
  She\'s a master of psychological warfare and is always pulling the
  strings from behind the scenes.

- **George Bluth Sr.:** The patriarch of the family, a corrupt real
  estate developer who is in and out of prison. George Sr. is a con man,
  a liar, and a terrible father. He\'s always running a scam and is the
  root cause of most of the family\'s problems.

- **Buster Bluth:** The socially awkward, coddled, and perpetually
  anxious youngest Bluth sibling. Buster is a \"scholar\" with a useless
  collection of degrees and is completely dependent on his mother. He\'s
  prone to panic attacks and is generally incompetent at everything he
  does.
