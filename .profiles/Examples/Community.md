## Step 1 & 2: Developer Roles & TV Show

- **TV Show:** *Community*

The developer roles and their preferred traits are outlined as
requested.

## Step 3: Character Profiling

- **Jeff Winger:** A cynical, charismatic ex-lawyer. He is a natural
  leader who can orchestrate complex social situations and persuade
  others to follow his vision, often with minimal effort. He excels at
  high-level strategy but avoids getting bogged down in details.

- **Annie Edison:** An ambitious, highly organized, and detail-oriented
  student. She thrives on structure, planning, and academic validation.
  Annie is meticulous, persistent, and driven by a need for perfection
  and order.

- **Abed Nadir:** A pop-culture obsessed, meta-commentating film student
  who sees the world through the lens of television and movies. He is a
  master of pattern recognition, systems analysis, and understanding how
  intricate parts form a whole. He often operates on a different, more
  logical plane than the rest of the group.

- **Britta Perry:** An activist who, despite her best intentions, often
  misunderstands situations and creates minor chaos. Her strength lies
  in her passion for challenging the status quo and pointing out flaws,
  even if her solutions aren\'t always perfect.

- **Shirley Bennett:** A kind but firm mother of three who often takes
  on a maternal role in the group. She is pragmatic, user-focused (in
  the sense of caring for the group\'s well-being), and skilled at
  navigating interpersonal dynamics to achieve a harmonious outcome.

- **Troy Barnes:** A former high school quarterback who embraces his
  nerdy, carefree side. He is creative, empathetic, and works incredibly
  well with Abed, often translating Abed\'s complex ideas into
  relatable, human terms.

- **Dean Craig Pelton:** The eccentric Dean of Greendale Community
  College. His defining trait is his relentless, often chaotic, drive to
  improve the school\'s image through endless new initiatives,
  templates, and themes, adapting them to fit any situation.

- **Ben Chang:** A highly unstable and unpredictable former Spanish
  teacher. His defining characteristic is his ability to find and
  exploit loopholes and weaknesses in any system for his own chaotic
  ends. He is relentless and operates entirely outside of established
  rules.
