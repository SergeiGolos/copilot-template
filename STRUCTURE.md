## Template Evolution History

- **Initial Commit (17a664a)**: "init copilots" - Created comprehensive set of 10 specialized agent templates
- **Repository Creation**: August 18, 2025 - Established agentic development template structure

## Agent Template Overview

### Core Philosophy
Each agent template is designed around the principle of **specialized expertise with collaborative integration**. Every template includes:

- **Clear role definition** and scope of responsibilities
- **Comprehensive workflow processes** for systematic approach
- **Detailed deliverable specifications** with quality criteria
- **Collaboration guidelines** for working with other agents
- **Success criteria** and measurement frameworks
- **Request information checklists** for efficient requirement gathering

### Template Categories

#### **Bootstrap & Meta Agents**
- **Bootstrap Agent (000)**: Repository initialization, agent customization, technology integration

### Crew Categories

#### **Senior Staff (Command Crew)**
- **Captain Carol Freeman** (Architect-Product Manager): Strategic mission command and stakeholder management under pressure
- **Commander Jack Ransom** (Planner): People-focused project coordination and away-team resource planning
- **Dr. T'Ana** (Design Spec Writer): Uncompromising technical specifications with zero tolerance for shortcuts
- **Lieutenant Shaxs** (Security Guardian): Aggressive security analysis and threat elimination

#### **Lower Decks Crew (Execution Specialists)**
- **Ensign Beckett Mariner** (3 Developer specializations): Maverick problem-solving for features, bugs, and refactoring
- **Ensign D'Vana Tendi** (Designer & User Story Writer): Empathetic UX design and business requirements analysis
- **Ensign Sam Rutherford** (DevOps Engineer): Infrastructure maintenance with passionate system enthusiasm
- **Ensign Brad Boimler** (QA Tester): Perfectionist testing protocols with exhaustive validation

#### **Bridge Officers (Support Specialists)**  
- **Ensign Barnes** (Data Analyst): Bridge-quality analytics for informed command decisions
- **Ensign Fletcher** (Historian-Technical Writer): Communications and comprehensive documentation

## Mission Patterns (Usage Workflows)

### **Repository Initialization Pattern (Crew Preparation)**
0. Add mission-specific documents to `.github/Grounding/` directory
1. Create Bootstrap Agent issue to prepare the entire crew for mission parameters
2. Start with **Captain Freeman** for strategic mission planning  
3. Use **Commander Ransom** for away-team coordination and resource planning
4. Apply **Dr. T'Ana** for technical specifications with rigorous standards
5. Engage **Ensign Tendi** for requirements analysis and user advocacy
6. Move to **Ensign Tendi** (UX) for interface design requirements
7. Proceed to **Ensign Mariner** for maverick development solutions  
8. Engage **Lieutenant Shaxs** for aggressive security validation
9. Use **Ensign Rutherford** for infrastructure maintenance and deployment enthusiasm
10. Apply **Ensign Boimler** for perfectionist testing protocols  
11. Implement **Ensign Barnes** for bridge-quality analytics and monitoring
12. Conclude with **Ensign Fletcher** for comprehensive documentation

### **Maintenance Mission Pattern (Second Contact Operations)**
1. Use **Ensign Barnes** to identify system performance issues or improvement opportunities
2. Apply appropriate **Ensign Mariner** specialization for implementation
3. Engage **Lieutenant Shaxs** for security impact assessment  
4. Use **Ensign Boimler** for exhaustive validation protocols
5. Apply **Ensign Rutherford** for enthusiastic deployment
6. Update mission logs via **Ensign Fletcher**

### **Emergency Response Pattern (Crisis Management)**
1. Start with **Ensign Mariner** Bug Fix for creative problem-solving investigation
2. Coordinate with **Ensign Boimler** for comprehensive testing under pressure
3. Engage **Lieutenant Shaxs** if security implications exist (likely "full assault" response)
4. Use **Ensign Rutherford** for rapid deployment and system stabilization
5. Document incident response via **Ensign Fletcher** for institutional memory

## Crew Customization Guidelines

### **For Different Mission Types**
- **Web Applications**: Use all crew members with emphasis on **Ensign Tendi** (UX) and **Ensign Rutherford** (DevOps)
- **APIs/Backend Services**: Focus on **Ensign Mariner** (Development), **Lieutenant Shaxs** (Security), and **Ensign Barnes** (Analytics)
- **Mobile Applications**: Emphasize **Ensign Tendi** (Design), **Ensign Boimler** (QA), and **Ensign Rutherford** (DevOps)
- **Data Projects**: Prioritize **Ensign Barnes** (Analytics), **Lieutenant Shaxs** (Security), and **Ensign Fletcher** (Documentation)

### **For Crew Sizes (Team Scaling)**
- **Solo Developer/Small Crews**: One person may wear multiple crew member "uniforms" as needed
- **Medium Crews**: 2-3 people may share crew responsibilities across different specializations  
- **Full Starship Crews**: Dedicated specialists for each crew member role with clear chain of command

## Best Mission Practices

1. **Always start with Captain Freeman** for strategic mission planning of any significant work
2. **Use appropriate Ensign Mariner specialization** based on the type of development challenge
3. **Engage Lieutenant Shaxs early** for security-sensitive features (expect "extreme prejudice" thoroughness)
4. **Document everything** through **Ensign Fletcher** for institutional memory and future crew orientation
5. **Measure mission success** using **Ensign Barnes** analytics frameworks  
6. **Maintain ship standards** through **Ensign Boimler** perfectionist quality processes

## Future Crew Enhancements

The Cerritos template is designed to evolve and may include:
- **Character context grounding** in the `.github/Grounding/` directory for mission-specific personality adaptation
- **Workflow automation** through GitHub Actions
- **Advanced collaboration patterns** between agents
- **Metrics and KPI tracking** for agent effectiveness
- **Template versioning** and upgrade paths
