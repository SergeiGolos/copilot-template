## Template Evolution History

- **Initial Commit (17a664a)**: "init copilots" - Created comprehensive set of 10 specialized agent templates
- **Repository Creation**: August 18, 2025 - Established agentic development template structure  
- **Star Trek Enterprise Theming**: August 2025 - Applied character-based themes to all issue templates while preserving technical functionality

## Agent Template Overview

## Agent Template Overview

### Core Philosophy
Each agent template is designed around the principle of **specialized expertise with collaborative integration**, now enhanced with Star Trek Enterprise character themes that add personality while maintaining professional functionality. Every template includes:

- **Character-themed role definitions** with personality traits and scope of responsibilities
- **Comprehensive workflow processes** with character-appropriate language and systematic approaches
- **Detailed deliverable specifications** with quality criteria and space-themed references
- **Bridge crew collaboration guidelines** for working with other character-themed agents
- **Mission success criteria** and measurement frameworks
- **Request information checklists** for efficient requirement gathering with appropriate humor

### Template Categories

#### **Bootstrap & Meta Agents**
- **Bootstrap Agent (000)**: Repository initialization, agent customization, technology integration *(unchanged from original)*

#### **Command Bridge (Strategic & Planning)**
- **Captain Archer (Architect-Product Manager)**: Strategic vision, stakeholder management, and architectural leadership
- **Sub-commander T'Pol (Planner)**: Logical project coordination, systematic planning, and process management

#### **Engineering Department (Implementation)**
- **Commander Tucker (Developer Feature)**: Hands-on feature development and engineering implementation
- **Ensign Mayweather (Developer Bug Fix)**: Navigation troubleshooting and frontend bug resolution  
- **Engineering Maintenance (Developer Refactoring)**: System optimization and code quality improvement
- **Engineering Systems (DevOps)**: Infrastructure automation and deployment operations

#### **Science & Communications (Design & Analysis)**
- **Ensign Sato (Designer)**: UI/UX design and user communication interfaces
- **Ship's Sensors (Data Analyst)**: Performance monitoring and behavioral analysis
- **Technical Specifications (Design Spec Writer)**: Engineering blueprint creation and documentation

#### **Security & Medical (Quality & Safety)**
- **Lieutenant Reed (Security Guardian)**: Security analysis and tactical system protection
- **Dr. Phlox (QA Tester)**: Comprehensive system diagnostics and health validation

#### **Ship Systems (Documentation & Operations)**
- **Ship's Computer (Historian-Writer)**: Knowledge management and mission log documentation
- **Mission Briefings (User Story Writer)**: Requirements translation and operational planning

## Usage Patterns

### **Repository Initialization Pattern**
0. Add project-specific documents to `.github/Grounding/` directory
1. Create Bootstrap Agent issue to customize all agents for project technology
2. Start with Architect-PM agent for strategic planning
3. Use Planner agent for project coordination and resource planning
4. Apply Design Spec Writer for technical specifications
5. Engage User Story Writer for implementation backlog
6. Move to Designer agent for UX/UI requirements
7. Proceed to Developer agents for implementation
8. Engage Security Guardian for security validation
9. Use DevOps for deployment and infrastructure
10. Apply QA Tester for comprehensive testing
11. Implement Data Analyst for metrics and monitoring
12. Conclude with Historian-Writer for documentation

### **Maintenance Pattern**
1. Use Data Analyst to identify issues or opportunities
2. Apply appropriate Developer agent for implementation
3. Engage Security Guardian for security impact assessment
4. Use QA Tester for validation
5. Apply DevOps for deployment
6. Update documentation via Historian-Writer

### **Bug Resolution Pattern**
1. Start with Developer Bug Fix template for systematic investigation
2. Coordinate with QA Tester for comprehensive testing
3. Engage Security Guardian if security implications exist
4. Use DevOps for deployment and monitoring
5. Document resolution via Historian-Writer

## Customization Guidelines

### **For Different Project Types**
- **Web Applications**: Use all agents with emphasis on Designer and DevOps
- **APIs/Backend Services**: Focus on Developer, Security Guardian, and Data Analyst
- **Mobile Applications**: Emphasize Designer, QA Tester, and DevOps
- **Data Projects**: Prioritize Data Analyst, Security Guardian, and Historian-Writer

### **For Team Sizes**
- **Individual/Small Teams**: One person may handle multiple agent roles
- **Medium Teams**: 2-3 people may share agent responsibilities
- **Large Teams**: Dedicated specialists for each agent role

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with Architect-PM** for any significant work
2. **Use appropriate Developer specialization** based on the type of work
3. **Engage Security Guardian early** for security-sensitive features
4. **Document everything** through Historian-Writer agent
5. **Measure success** using Data Analyst frameworks
6. **Maintain quality** through QA Tester processes

## Future Enhancements

The template is designed to evolve and may include:
- **Agent context grounding** in the `.github/Grounding/` directory
- **Workflow automation** through GitHub Actions
- **Advanced collaboration patterns** between agents
- **Metrics and KPI tracking** for agent effectiveness
- **Template versioning** and upgrade paths
