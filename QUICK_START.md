- Share deliverables between crew members through issue comments
- Use mission boards to track crew dependencies

## üîß Ship Configuration for Your Crew Size

### **Small Crew (1-3 people)**
*"Just the three of us. We can handle this."*
- One person may wear multiple character "hats"
- Focus on the most critical characters for your mission type

**Ready to fly?** 

*"We have done the impossible, and that makes us mighty."*

1. **Start by creating grounding documents** in `.github/Grounding/` with your technology stack
2. **Use the Bootstrap Agent** (`000_agent.md`) to customize all crew members for your project  
3. **Then create your first Captain's mission** using Malcolm Reynolds template to define your project's strategic direction
4. **Follow up with your Soldier** (Zo√´ Washburne) for tactical implementation planning

*Remember: The crew system is a framework for organized thinking and development - adapt it to your ship's needs and mission requirements.*

*Remember: The agent system is a framework for organized thinking and development - adapt it to your team's needs and context.*
