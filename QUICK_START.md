# Quick Start Guide - Deep Space Nine Development Template

*"Every great space station begins as just a collection of ideas and the determination to make them real."* - Captain Benjamin Sisko

## üöÄ Welcome to Your New Assignment

You've been assigned to transform your development project using the Deep Space Nine model. This guide will help you get your "station" operational and your character-based development crew working together effectively.

## üéØ Phase 1: Station Initialization (30 minutes)

### 1. **Bootstrap Your Station**
- Create an issue using the **Deep Space Nine - Station Initialization** template
- Define your project's mission parameters and technology stack
- Identify which team members will embody which characters
- Customize the character templates for your specific context

### 2. **Assign Character Roles**
Consider your team's strengths and project needs:

**Essential Characters** (minimum viable crew):

### 3. **Establish Character Communication**
Set up channels for character coordination:
- **Command briefings**: Regular status meetings led by Sisko
- **Engineering consultations**: Technical discussions between O'Brien, Dax, and Bashir
- **Security briefings**: Odo and Worf coordinate on quality and security
- **User advocacy**: Kira and Ezri ensure user needs stay central

## üéØ Phase 2: Mission Planning (1-2 hours)

### **The Planning Sequence**
Follow the natural character hierarchy for project planning:

1. **Captain Sisko** (Project Manager)
   - Create strategic vision and project charter
   - Define success criteria and stakeholder objectives
   - Establish timeline and resource allocation

2. **Major Kira** (Stakeholder Advocate)
   - Validate that user needs are central to the strategic vision
   - Challenge assumptions about what users actually want
   - Ensure inclusive representation of all affected parties

3. **Lt. Commander Dax** (Technical Architect)
   - Translate strategic vision into technical architecture
   - Design system specifications and integration patterns
   - Plan for scalability and future evolution

4. **Vedek Bareil** (User Story Facilitator)

## üè∑Ô∏è Character-Based Issue Management

### **Labeling Strategy**
Use character-based labels to organize your workflow:
- `sisko-command` - Strategic leadership and project management
- `kira-advocacy` - User advocacy and stakeholder representation
- `obrien-ops` - Infrastructure and operational work
- `dax-architecture` - Technical architecture and design
- `bashir-development` - Feature development and implementation
- `bashir-debugging` - Bug investigation and resolution
- `bashir-research` - Optimization and refactoring
- `odo-qa` - Quality assurance and testing
- `worf-security` - Security and compliance
- `quark-analytics` - Business intelligence and analytics
- `garak-documentation` - Documentation and knowledge management
- `ezri-ux` - User experience and design
- `bareil-stories` - User story creation and facilitation
- `ds9-setup` - System initialization and configuration

### **Character Coordination**
- Reference related character issues in collaboration sections
- Use @mentions to coordinate between character roles
- Share deliverables through issue comments and documentation links
- Track cross-character dependencies using project boards

## ü§ñ Working with AI Character Assistants

### **When Creating Character Issues**
1. **Be specific** about your requirements and character context
2. **Provide examples** of current systems or desired outcomes
3. **Include character-appropriate constraints** and considerations
4. **Reference other character work** that provides additional context
5. **Use character voice** and perspective when possible

### **Character Template Customization**
- Modify character templates to match your technology stack
- Add project-specific questions to character requirement sections
- Adjust success criteria to match your quality standards and character expectations
- Include your team's specific processes and tools in character workflows

### **Multi-Character Coordination**
- Start character issues in logical sequence (often Sisko ‚Üí Kira ‚Üí Dax ‚Üí others)
- Reference related character issues in collaboration sections
- Share deliverables between characters through issue comments and links
- Use project boards to track cross-character dependencies and workflows

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### **Character Authenticity Issues**
- **Problem**: Using characters just as labels without embracing their personalities
- **Solution**: Read character descriptions and embody their approaches and perspectives

### **Collaboration Breakdowns**  
- **Problem**: Characters working in isolation without coordination
- **Solution**: Follow established character relationships and communication patterns

### **Mission Drift**
- **Problem**: Characters pursuing their individual goals without considering the overall mission
- **Solution**: Regular command briefings and mission-focused success criteria

### **Resource Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Characters competing for the same resources or authority
- **Solution**: Clear role definitions and escalation paths through Captain Sisko

## üìö Advanced Character Development

As your team becomes more comfortable with the DS9 approach:

### **Character Growth Arcs**
- Allow characters to evolve and learn from each other over time
- Document character development and lessons learned
- Share successful character collaboration patterns with the community

### **Extended Character Network**
- Consider adding guest characters for special projects (Odo's Cardassian contacts, Dax's previous hosts)
- Explore character backstories for deeper project context
- Use character relationships to guide team building and collaboration

### **Character Specialization**
- Develop deeper expertise in your primary character roles
- Cross-train on secondary character capabilities
- Create character succession plans for team growth and changes
