## üè∑Ô∏è Issue Management Tips

### **Labeling Strategy**
Use these labels to organize your agentic workflow:
- `bootstrap` - Bootstrap agent work (repository customization)
- `command` - Captain Sisko work (strategic architecture)
- `stakeholder-advocacy` - Major Kira work (user-focused planning)
- `symbiont-wisdom` - Lt. Commander Dax work (technical specifications)
- `storytelling` - Jake Sisko work (user stories)
- `user-experience` - Leeta work (design and hospitality)
- `enhancement` - Dr. Bashir work (new features with precision)
- `bug` - Nog work (systematic bug fixes)
- `refactoring` - Rom work (methodical code improvements)
- `security` - Lt. Commander Worf work (honor-driven security)
- `devops` - Chief O'Brien work (infrastructure under pressure)
- `qa` - Constable Odo work (incorruptible quality assurance)
- `data-analysis` - Quark work (profit-driven analytics)
- `documentation` - Professor Jennifer Sisko work (academic documentation)

### **Project Board Setup**
Create columns for:
1. **Backlog** - Planned agent work
2. **Bootstrap** - Repository customization and agent setup

## ü§ñ Working with AI Assistants

### **When Creating Issues**
1. **Be specific** about your requirements and context
2. **Provide examples** of current systems or desired outcomes
3. **Include constraints** like timeline, budget, or technical limitations
4. **Reference other issues** that provide additional context

### **Template Customization**
- Modify agent templates to match your tech stack
- Add project-specific questions to requirement sections
- Adjust success criteria to match your quality standards
- Include your team's specific processes and tools

### **Multi-Agent Coordination**
