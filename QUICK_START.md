## üè∑Ô∏è Issue Management Tips

### **Labeling Strategy**
Use these labels to organize your SG-1 agentic workflow:
- `bootstrap` - Bootstrap agent work (repository customization)
- `oneill-strategic` - O'Neill strategic command work
- `oneill-planning` - O'Neill mission planning work  
- `carter-specs` - Carter technical specifications work
- `daniel-stories` - Daniel user advocacy work
- `daniel-ux` - Daniel user experience work
- `carter-implementation` - Carter technical implementation
- `carter-debug` - Carter technical debugging
- `carter-optimization` - Carter system optimization
- `tealc-security` - Teal'c security guardian work
- `carter-infrastructure` - Carter infrastructure work
- `tealc-qa` - Teal'c quality assurance work
- `carter-data` - Carter data analysis work
- `daniel-docs` - Daniel documentation work

### **Project Board Setup**
Create columns for:
1. **Backlog** - Planned agent work
2. **Bootstrap** - Repository customization and agent setup
3. **Planning** - Strategic and project planning (Architect-PM, Planner)
4. **Specification** - Design specs and user stories (Design Spec Writer, User Story Writer)
5. **In Progress** - Active agent work
6. **Review** - Agent deliverables under review
7. **Done** - Completed agent work

### **Milestone Planning**
Organize work into milestones like:
- **Repository Bootstrap** (Bootstrap Agent setup and customization)
- **Strategic Planning** (Architect-PM + Planner)
- **Requirements & Specifications** (Design Spec Writer + User Story Writer)
- **MVP Planning** (Designer + User Story Writer)
- **Core Implementation** (Developer + Security + QA)
- **Production Readiness** (DevOps + Data Analyst + Historian-Writer)

## ü§ñ Working with AI Assistants

### **When Creating Issues**
1. **Be specific** about your requirements and context
2. **Provide examples** of current systems or desired outcomes
3. **Include constraints** like timeline, budget, or technical limitations
4. **Reference other issues** that provide additional context

### **Template Customization**
- Modify agent templates to match your tech stack
- Add project-specific questions to requirement sections
- Adjust success criteria to match your quality standards
- Include your team's specific processes and tools

### **Multi-Agent Coordination**
- Start issues in logical sequence (Architect-PM first)
- Reference related issues in the collaboration sections
- Share deliverables between agents through issue comments
- Use project boards to track cross-agent dependencies

## üîß Customization for Your Team

### **Small Team (1-3 people)**
- One person may handle multiple agent roles
- Focus on the most critical agents for your project type
- Simplify templates by removing sections not relevant to your context
- Use the agent structure for systematic thinking even if one person does all work

### **Medium Team (4-8 people)**
- Assign primary and secondary agents to team members
- Create agent expertise areas within the team
- Use the templates for knowledge sharing and onboarding
- Establish review processes for agent deliverables

### **Large Team (8+ people)**
- Assign dedicated specialists to agent roles
- Create agent working groups for complex decisions
- Use templates for standardized communication and deliverables
- Implement formal handoffs between agent responsibilities

## üìä Measuring Success

### **Agent Effectiveness Metrics**
- **Bootstrap Agent**: Template customization accuracy, project-specific context integration
- **Architect-PM**: Requirement clarity, successful implementation rate
- **Planner**: Project timeline accuracy, resource utilization efficiency
- **Design Spec Writer**: Specification completeness, implementation success rate
- **User Story Writer**: Story quality, development velocity improvement
- **Designer**: User satisfaction, accessibility compliance
- **Developer**: Code quality, delivery time, bug rate
- **Security Guardian**: Vulnerability detection, compliance rate
- **DevOps**: Deployment success, system reliability
- **QA Tester**: Defect detection, test coverage
- **Data Analyst**: Insight quality, metric improvement
- **Historian-Writer**: Documentation usage, knowledge transfer efficiency

### **Process Improvement**
- Track time from issue creation to resolution
- Monitor cross-agent collaboration effectiveness
- Measure deliverable quality and stakeholder satisfaction
- Identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
- **Too much overhead**: Simplify templates for your context
- **Agent coordination problems**: Use project boards and clear dependencies
- **Template complexity**: Focus on sections most relevant to your needs
- **Knowledge silos**: Ensure Historian-Writer captures all decisions

### **Getting Help**
- Review the comprehensive agent templates for guidance
- Use the collaboration sections to coordinate between agents
- Create meta-issues for discussing the agent system itself
- Iterate and improve your agent usage patterns

**Ready to go?** 

1. **Start by creating grounding documents** in `.github/Grounding/` with your technology stack
2. **Use the Bootstrap Agent** (`000_agent.md`) to customize all agents for your project
3. **Then create your first Architect-PM issue** to define your project's strategic direction, followed by the planning workflow through Planner ‚Üí Design Spec Writer ‚Üí User Story Writer!

*Remember: The agent system is a framework for organized thinking and development - adapt it to your team's needs and context.*
