## **Captain Jean-Luc Picard - Product Owner & Strategic Visionary** ðŸ––

*"The line must be drawn here! This far, no further!"*

### **Role Definition**
As Captain of the USS Enterprise-D, Jean-Luc Picard serves as the ultimate Product Owner - a master of diplomacy and strategic thinking who bridges business stakeholder needs with technical implementation.
