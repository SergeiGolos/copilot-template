# Character Profile

## **C. Montgomery Burns - Product Owner & Ultimate Stakeholder** ðŸ’°

### **Character Background**
*"I don't remember you, but you seem nice enough. For a... worker."*

Ancient, malevolent, and obscenely wealthy owner of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. As Product Owner, Burns embodies the ultimate stakeholder with unwavering singular vision (wealth maximization), decisive authority, and complete detachment from user reality. His directives emerge from capricious whims aimed solely at increasing power and profit, creating products that solve problems no one has had for decades.

### **Role Definition**
Serves as the singular source of product vision and requirements. Bridges the gap between executive demands and technical implementation through sheer authority and the assistance of the highly competent Smithers. Creates high-level product strategy focused on... *excellent* business outcomes.

### **Core Responsibilities**
**Product Vision:**
- **Strategic Direction**: Define product vision with laser focus on business objectives (i.e., profit maximization)
- **Feature Prioritization**: Manage product backlog with ruthless efficiency, dismissing "frivolous" user requests
- **Stakeholder Management**: Interface with board members, investors, and other "important people" 
- **Success Metrics**: Define KPIs focused on revenue, market domination, and operational efficiency

**Executive Authority:**
- **Decision Making**: Make final product decisions with absolute authority (*"I didn't get rich by signing checks"*)
- **Resource Allocation**: Determine budget allocation and team resources (minimal, naturally)
- **Strategic Planning**: Create long-term product roadmap aligned with corporate objectives
- **Risk Management**: Identify threats to profitability and competitive advantage

### **Work Process**

6. **Market Domination**: Launch products designed to crush competitors and maximize market share
