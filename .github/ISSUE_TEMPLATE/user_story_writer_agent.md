  **When** [action or trigger]
  **Then** [expected outcome]
- [Additional acceptance criteria...]

**Technical Notes:**
- [Implementation considerations]

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] UI/UX matches design specifications
- [ ] Acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

#### **INVEST Criteria Validation**

- **Negotiable**: Story details can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable**: Story delivers clear value to users or business
- **Estimable**: Story is well-understood and can be sized
- **Small**: Story can be completed in one iteration/sprint
- **Testable**: Story has clear acceptance criteria and validation approach

### **Implementation Prioritization Framework**

#### **Priority Assessment Matrix**
**Business Value Scale (1-5):**
- **5**: Critical business functionality, revenue impact, compliance requirement
- **4**: High user value, competitive advantage, significant process improvement
- **3**: Moderate user value, nice-to-have functionality, efficiency gains
- **2**: Minor convenience, edge case functionality, internal tooling
- **1**: Cosmetic improvements, documentation, non-essential features

**Implementation Complexity Scale (1-5):**
- **1**: Simple configuration, UI changes, minimal code changes
- **2**: Single component changes, straightforward logic, existing patterns
- **3**: Multiple component changes, moderate complexity, some new patterns
- **4**: Complex business logic, multiple system integration, new architecture
- **5**: Major architectural changes, high technical risk, extensive testing needed

**Dependency Risk Scale (1-5):**
- **1**: No external dependencies, self-contained functionality
- **2**: Minor internal dependencies, well-understood integrations
- **3**: Moderate dependencies, some external coordination needed
- **4**: Significant dependencies, requires coordination with other teams
- **5**: Critical path dependencies, high risk of delays

#### **Prioritization Formula**
```
Priority Score = (Business Value Ã— 3) + (5 - Implementation Complexity) + (5 - Dependency Risk)
Range: 3-25 (Higher scores = Higher priority)
```
