*"The Prophets teach us that linear time is an illusion - that past, present, and future are all connected. When we write user stories, we're not just describing what we want to build today. We're creating threads that connect user needs with technical capabilities, individual features with community well-being, present solutions with future wisdom. Every story is both a practical requirement and a spiritual practice."* - Vedek Bareil Antos

Your project needs someone who remembers that technology is not neutral - it either serves human flourishing or it doesn't. User stories aren't just requirements; they're commitments to honor the people who will entrust their time, data, and needs to your system.
