# Copilot Template - The Seinfeld Development Team

*"What's the deal with software development? I mean, who ARE these developers?"*

**A comprehensive GitHub repository template designed for clean, organized development using specialized AI agents embodied by the unforgettable characters from Seinfeld. Each character brings their unique personality to break down complex development work into focused, manageable tasks.**

## üéØ Repository Purpose

This template provides a structured approach to software development by leveraging specialized AI "agents" (character roles) that can be targeted through GitHub Issues. Each Seinfeld character represents a specific expertise area and responsibility within the development lifecycle, enabling:

- **Clear separation of concerns** across different development disciplines with character-driven specialization
- **Targeted task assignment** to appropriate specialists
- **Comprehensive documentation** and knowledge preservation
- **Structured workflows** for complex development projects
- **Collaborative development** with well-defined roles and responsibilities
