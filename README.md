- **Targeted task assignment** to appropriate specialists (each with their unique personality and expertise)
- **Comprehensive documentation** and knowledge preservation (maintained by Ship's Computer)
- **Structured workflows** for complex development projects (coordinated by the Bridge crew)
- **Collaborative development** with well-defined roles and responsibilities (like a well-functioning starship)
- **Targeted task assignment** to appropriate specialists
- **Comprehensive documentation** and knowledge preservation
- **Structured workflows** for complex development projects
- **Collaborative development** with well-defined roles and responsibilities
