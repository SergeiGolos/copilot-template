# Copilot Template - SG-1 Agentic Development System

**"Indeed. This development approach is... effective."** - *Teal'c*

A GitHub repository template featuring **Stargate SG-1** themed AI agents for structured, cross-functional development. Each agent represents a specialized role based on the iconic SG-1 team members, bringing their unique expertise and personality to your development workflow.

### üîß **Bootstrap Agent** (`000_agent.md`)
- **SPECIAL ROLE**: Repository initialization and agent customization
- Project-specific technology integration and context application
- Grounding document processing from `.github/Grounding/` directory
- Systematic update of ALL agent templates with project-specific information
- Technology stack analysis and agent template transformation

### üéØ **Planner Agent** (`planner_agent.md`)ent Starter

**A comprehensive GitHub repository template designed for clean, organized development using specialized AI agents to break down complex development work into focused, manageable tasks.**

## üéØ Repository Purpose

This template provides a structured approach to software development by leveraging specialized AI "agents" (roles) that can be targeted through GitHub Issues. Each agent represents a specific expertise area and responsibility within the development lifecycle, enabling:

- **Clear separation of concerns** across different development disciplines
- **Targeted task assignment** to appropriate specialists
- **Comprehensive documentation** and knowledge preservation
- **Structured workflows** for complex development projects
- **Collaborative development** with well-defined roles and responsibilities

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The repository implements an **Agentic Development Model** where different aspects of software development are handled by specialized agents, each with distinct capabilities and responsibilities:

### Core Development Agents

| Agent | Focus Area | Primary Responsibilities |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Bootstrap Agent** | Repository Initialization | Project-specific agent customization, technology integration, grounding document processing |
| **Architect-PM** | Strategy & Planning | Requirements analysis, system design, risk assessment, roadmap planning |
| **Planner** | Project Coordination | Strategic project planning, resource coordination, sprint planning, dependency management |
| **Design Spec Writer** | Technical Specifications | Technical design documentation, API specifications, system integration specs |
| **User Story Writer** | Requirements Translation | Convert specs to user stories, implementation prioritization, backlog management |
| **Developer** | Implementation | Feature development, bug fixes, code refactoring, technical implementation |
## üåå SG-1 Themed Agent System

**"We came, we saw, we coded!"**

This template now features **Stargate SG-1** themed agent roles based on the elite four-person team that exemplifies perfect cross-functional collaboration. Each character archetype maps naturally to essential development roles:

| **SG-1 Character** | **Role Archetype** | **Development Responsibilities** |
|---|---|---|
| **Colonel Jack O'Neill** | Pragmatic Leader | Strategic planning, mission coordination, stakeholder management, operational leadership |
| **Dr. Samantha Carter** | Technical Architect | All technical implementation, system engineering, performance optimization, infrastructure |
| **Dr. Daniel Jackson** | Empathetic Advocate | User experience, cultural context, documentation, knowledge preservation |
| **Teal'c** | Quality Guardian | Security assessment, quality assurance, system reliability, disciplined testing |

*The original agent functionality remains unchanged - only the presentation is themed with lighthearted, office-appropriate character references.*
