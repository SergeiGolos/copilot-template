# Copilot Template - Agentic AI Dev## üìã Issue Templates System

Each agent has dedicated GitHub Issue templates that provide structured workflows and comprehensive requirements gathering:

### üîß **Bootstrap Agent** (`000_agent.md`)
- **SPECIAL ROLE**: Repository initialization and agent customization
- Project-specific technology integration and context application
- Grounding document processing from `.github/Grounding/` directory

### üéØ **Planner Agent** (`planner_agent.md`)ent Starter

**A comprehensive GitHub repository template designed for clean, organized development using specialized AI agents to break down complex development work into focused, manageable tasks.**

## üéØ Repository Purpose

This template provides a structured approach to software development by leveraging specialized AI "agents" (roles) that can be targeted through GitHub Issues. Each agent represents a specific expertise area and responsibility within the development lifecycle, enabling:

- **Clear separation of concerns** across different development disciplines
- **Targeted task assignment** to appropriate specialists
- **Comprehensive documentation** and knowledge preservation
- **Structured workflows** for complex development projects
- **Collaborative development** with well-defined roles and responsibilities

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The repository implements an **Agentic Development Model** where different aspects of software development are handled by specialized agents, each with distinct capabilities and responsibilities:

## üéØ How to Use This Template

### 1. **Repository Setup**
```bash
# Create new repository from this template
gh repo create your-project --template SergeiGolos/copilot-template
cd your-project
```

### 2. **Project Initialization**
- Add project-specific context documents to `.github/Grounding/` directory
- Create a Bootstrap Agent issue (`000_agent.md`) to analyze and customize all agents
- Review and customize issue templates for your project's specific needs
- Set up labels and project boards to match the agent structure
- Configure branch protection rules and workflow requirements

### 3. **Agent-Based Development Workflow**

#### **Bootstrap Phase** (Repository Customization)
0. Create grounding documents in `.github/Grounding/` with your technology stack
1. Use `000_agent.md` template to bootstrap and customize all agents for your project
2. Validate that all agents now contain project-specific technology and context

#### **Planning Phase** (Architect-PM ‚Üí Planner ‚Üí Design Spec Writer ‚Üí User Story Writer)
1. Create an issue using the `architect_product_manager.md` template for strategic planning
2. Use `planner_agent.md` for project coordination and resource planning
3. Apply `design_spec_writer_agent.md` for technical specifications
4. Utilize `user_story_writer_agent.md` to convert specs into prioritized user stories
5. Receive comprehensive system design, project roadmap, and implementation backlog

#### **Implementation Phase** (Specialized Agents)
1. **Design**: Use `designer_agent.md` for UI/UX requirements
2. **Development**: Use appropriate developer template (`feature_implementation.md`, `bug_fix.md`, or `code_refactoring.md`)
3. **Security**: Use `security_guardian_agent.md` for security analysis
4. **Infrastructure**: Use `devops_engineer_agent.md` for deployment needs
5. **Quality**: Use `qa_tester_agent.md` for testing strategy
6. **Analytics**: Use `data_analyst_agent.md` for metrics and analysis

#### **Documentation Phase** (Historian-Writer Agent)
1. Use `historian_technical_writer.md` for comprehensive documentation
2. Ensure knowledge preservation and decision context recording
3. Create user guides, API documentation, and maintenance procedures

### 4. **Collaborative Development**
- Each issue template includes collaboration guidelines with other agents
- Cross-agent dependencies are clearly defined
- Deliverables from each agent inform the work of others

## üîÑ Serenity Crew Collaboration Matrix

*"We're family. Weird, dysfunctional family."*

Each crew member works collaboratively with the others, creating a network of expertise and mutual support:
