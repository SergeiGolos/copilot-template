## üöÄ Welcome to the U.S.S. Cerritos

The Cerritos is a California-class vessel specializing in "second contact" missions - the essential but unglamorous work of maintenance, support, and iterative improvement that keeps systems operational. This template embraces that reality, providing a character-themed framework where different aspects of software development are handled by specialized crew members, each with distinct personalities and capabilities.

## üìã Crew Roster & Specializations

Each crew member has dedicated GitHub Issue templates that provide structured workflows and comprehensive requirements gathering:

### üîß **Bootstrap Agent** (`000_agent.md`)
- **SPECIAL ROLE**: Repository initialization and agent customization
- Project-specific technology integration and context application
- Grounding document processing from `.github/Grounding/` directory
- Systematic update of ALL agent templates with project-specific information
- Technology stack analysis and agent template transformation

### üéØ **Planner Agent** (`planner_agent.md`)ent Starter
