# Copilot Template - Rick & Morty Edition

**Wubba lubba dub dub! A comprehensive GitHub repository template for interdimensional development using Rick & Morty character-themed AI agents.**

*"Listen Morty, development is about breaking down complex problems into focused, manageable tasks. Each agent represents a specific expertise - like how I'm the genius architect and you're the... well, you're the junior developer."*
